You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I haven't really learned any new skills yet but I have changed my style of html and css coding.
as well as learning more about css.

Most of this section has been easy for me.  

Challenging parts have been remembering propersyntax between study sessions.

Used google and previous projects to find the correct tags and syntax to format the page
as I want.
